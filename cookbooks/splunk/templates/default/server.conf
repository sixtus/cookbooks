# The following 'allowRemoteLogin' setting controls remote management of your splunk instance.
#  - If set to 'always', all remote logins are allowed.
#  - If set to 'never', only local logins to splunkd will be allowed. Note that this will still allow
#    remote management through splunkweb if splunkweb is on the same server.
#  - If set to 'requireSetPassword' (default behavior):
#     1. In the free license, remote login is disabled.
#     2. In the pro license, remote login is only disabled for the admin user that has not changed their default password
